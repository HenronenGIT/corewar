## corewar

Corewar is a multiplayer game, where champions fight for memory in a virtual arena. The winner of the game is the last champion to have played the live statement. For this project 2 parts needed to be created. First the assembler that would take a file of instructions and convert that file into bytecode that is readable by the virtual machine. The second part was the virtual machine which would take the champions and create the arena where the champions will fight to the death. After that the VM is able to execute instructions from all the champions according to the game rules.

## Assembler

The assmebler was worked on by Otto and Henri. The purpose of the Assembler was to take a champion file and convert it to bytecode. It was basically a simplified compiler. We had divided the work into 2 parts, where Henri would work on parsing and analyzing the original input file and converting the values in that file into a structure that was then taken by Otto. Otto would convert the values from that structure into that final bytecode and print that information into a file.


## Virtual Machine 
Coming soon...
